    "\n",
    "* languages without grammatical perfects such as Russian may exhibit more extensive use of morphemes meaning \"already\" to make up for the lack of a perfect. (Bybee, Dahl 1989: 68)\n",
    "* Anteriors do not readily combine with adverbials like \"still\" while resultatives do \"very easily\". (idem 1989: 69). \n",
    "* Anteriors are often accompanied with \"already\" or \"just\" (Bybee, Perkens, Pagliuca 1994: 54).\n",
    "* In British and American English, the most common adverbial collocations with the present perfect (\"has *verbed*\") are \"(ever) since (+temporal noun phrase or clause). (Schl√ºter 2002)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perfectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given Bybee and Dahl's claim that languages without anteriors may deploy more extensively words like \"already\" (1989: 68), it is sensible to expect the perfective would be the verb of choice: i.e. perfective + \"already\" *might* be more common than anterior + \"already\". But this is complicated by the fact that the anterior already prefers \"already\" (see above)."

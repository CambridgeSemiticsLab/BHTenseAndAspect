        Overlapping constructions form a graph wherein constructions 
        are nodes and the overlaps are edges. The graph indicates
        that the constructions function together as one single unit.
        weaveCX combines all constructions into a single one. Moving
        from right-to-left (Hebrew), the function consumes and subsumes
        subsequent constructions to previous ones. The result is a 
        single unit with embedding based on the order of consumption.
        Roles in previous constructions are thus expanded into the 
        constructions of their subsequent constituents.
        
        For instance, take the following phrase in English:
        
            >    "to the dog"
            
        Say a CXbuilder object contains basic noun patterns and can
        recognize the following contained constructions:
        
            >    cx Preposition: ('prep', to), ('obj', the),
            >    cx Definite: ('art', the), ('noun', dog)
        
        When the words of the constructions are compared, an overlap
        can be seen:
        
            >    cx Preposition:    to  the
            >    cx Definite:           the  dog
        
        The overlap in this case is "the". The overlap suggests that
        the slot filled by "the" in the Preposition construction 
        should be expanded. This can be done by remapping the role
        filled by "the" alone to the subsequent Definite construction.
        This results in embedding:
        
            >    cx Preposition: ('prep', to), 
                                 ('obj', cx Definite: ('art', the), 
                                                      ('noun', dog))
        
        weaveCX accomplishes this by calling the updaterole method native
        to Construction objects. The end result is a list of merged 
        constructions that contain embedding.
        
        Args: 
            cxlist: a list of constructions pre-sorted for word order;
                the list shrinks throughout recursive iteration until

                is a set of dominating constructions. Important for, e.g.,

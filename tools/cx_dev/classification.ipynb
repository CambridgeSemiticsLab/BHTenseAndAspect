    "This notebook will seek to establish a taxonomy of time phrases in Biblical Hebrew that is as comprehensive as possible. The `Construction` object is used as the starting point for the analysis. We already have a set of `Construction` objects (henceforth simply \"cx\") that have been preprocessed based on their subphrase grammar. These subphrases allow us to make certain selections of the data and place labels on the time phrases."

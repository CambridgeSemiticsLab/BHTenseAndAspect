# Biblical Hebrew Time Collocations

This repository will store data for Cody Kingham's PhD project on time expressions in Biblical Hebrew and their collocations with verbal and discourse constructions. This project combines methodologies from the fields of cognitive linguistics, construction grammar, and corpus-driven collostructional analysis (e.g. Stefanowitsch and Gries 2003).

The primary data for this project is the Hebrew syntax data from the [ETCBC, VU Amsterdam](https://github.com/ETCBC). The dataset is accessed and manipulated using the corpus analysis and annotation tool, [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric), of [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/about/organisation-and-policy/staff/roorda) (Netherlands).

* [Time Phrases in Standard Biblical Hebrew](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CambridgeSemiticsLab/BH_time_collocations/blob/master/analysis/SBH_time_expressions.ipynb) — Exploratory analysis of the ETCBC "Time" phrase in Genesis–Kings.
* [Verb Collocations with Atelic Time Duration Adverbials](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CambridgeSemiticsLab/BH_time_collocations/blob/master/analysis/duratives.ipynb) - A pilot study examining the collocations of atelic time duration adverbials with various verb lexemes in the Hebrew Bible, based on Fuhs' 2010 collostructional analysis ([source](https://philpapers.org/rec/FUHTAC)).

# Analysis of Hebrew Time Adverbial Collocations

This directory contains the primary analysis notebooks and scripts for the project. These notebooks mainly rely on the data produced in the [data directory](../data/production). There is not a satisfying, clear line between "analysis" and "data production," since the two both feed into each other in a constant loop of exploration, discovery, and refinement. But, generally, the data production stage comes first and feeds into the analysis. Subsequent analyses must then be integrated into a satisfying description of the data production, so that the insights are not missed along the way.

## Contents

The analyses in this directory are to be organized by topic, itself broadly arranged in a natural data-discovery progression, going from identity, distribution, to an analysis of internal and external collocational patterns.  

* [tools](tools) - Python scripts used for analyzing the data.
* [exploratory](0_exploratory) - Notebooks in the first stages of exploration of the the ETCBC `Time` phrases, mostly limited to SBH texts.

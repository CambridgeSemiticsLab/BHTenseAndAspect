# Biblical Hebrew Time Collocations
## Analysis

This directory contains the primary analysis notebooks and scripts for the project. These notebooks primarily rely on the data produced in the [data directory](../data/production). There is not a satisfying, clear line between "analysis" and "data production," since the two both feed into each other in a constant loop of exploration, discovery, and refinement. But, generally, the data production stage comes first and feeds into the analysis. Subsequent analyses must then be integrated into a satisfying description of the data production, so that the insights are not missed along the way.

### Contents

The analyses in this directory are to be organized by topic, itself broadly arranged in a natural data-discovery progression, going from identity, distribution, to an analysis of internal and external collocational patterns.  

* [1_identity](1_identity) - Notebooks describing the general identity of time adverbials in Biblical Hebrew and related issues
* [2_distribution](2_distribution) - Notebooks describing the distribution of time adverbials in Biblical Hebrew and related issues.
* [3_internal_collocations](3_internal_collocations) - Notebooks looking at the internal collocation patterns of time adverbials. In other words, this examines the collocational tendencies of time words and their modifiers as a way of getting at semantic meaning.
* [4_external_collocations](4_external_collocations) - Notebooks that examine the collocational tendencies of time adverbials with external elements, including sentence arguments, verbs, and discourse contexts.
